         In the past, for 12 years, there was no rainfall, and all the river dried off. To find out the solution to this problem, the King of Bhaktapur kingdom at that time went to Swayambhu to meet Tantrik. Then, the Tantrik said that Guru Gorakhnath is angry,

        Until and unless the serpents will be free, rainfall doesn’t happen in the valley. It is possible only when his teacher Rato Machhindranath visits him. So the king started searching for his teacher. After some time, they find out that Machhindranath was reborn as the 108th son of King Sashi in Assam.
        Then the king of Bhaktapur, Tantrik from Kathmandu, and a Newar from Lalitpur went to Assam to bring Machhindranath back. They knew that it wouldn’t be easy to get him because he was the son of Daitya. They tried a lot but they were not successful in bringing him back.
        Then the Tantrik called 4 Bhairab and asked them to bring him back. Bhairab brought him back to Guru Gorakhnath, and he stood quietly seeing his teacher. Finally, the serpents were free then the rain started raining on the valley.
        Now, the king, Tantrik, and Newar cannot decide how district Machhindranath should be kept, so they went to Lalitpur King to find the solution. Lalitpur King was very clever as he chose to keep RatoMachhindranath on Lalitpur. From that day, every year, people celebrate this
